for the edges: do the normal stuff in a for loop with the left-right vertices ajusting to the size and range includes the smallest interger but not the largest
like:

for i in range(-self.size, self.size, 2):
    # have the list of lists of lists in here
    # I may have to do it side by side or corner-to-corner by corner-to-corner
